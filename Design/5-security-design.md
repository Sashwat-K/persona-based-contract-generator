# IBM Confidential Computing Contract Generator - Security Design

> **Version:** 1.1  
> **Date:** 2026-04-18  
> **Status:** Implementation-aligned security reference  
> **Source of Truth:** `backend/internal/*`, `backend/cmd/server/main.go`, `app/main/index.js`, `app/index.html`, compose/nginx configs

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the current security architecture, controls, and operational guardrails for:

- backend API (`backend/`)
- desktop client (`app/`)
- reverse proxy and deployment runtime (`docker-compose*.yaml`, `config/nginx/*.conf`)

If this document conflicts with code, code is authoritative.

---

## 2. Security Objectives

The platform is designed to:

- preserve private-key confidentiality on client devices
- enforce least privilege via role + per-build assignment checks
- ensure tamper-evident workflow history with cryptographic audit linkage
- prevent unauthorized state transitions and replay of mutating requests
- provide secure-by-default deployment posture for on-prem/self-hosted environments

---

## 3. Threat Model and Trust Boundaries

### 3.1 Trust Boundaries

1. **Desktop (trusted for identity key operations):**
   - identity keys (RSA-4096) generated/stored locally
   - request signing runs in Electron main process
2. **Backend (trusted for contract cryptography, untrusted for plaintext secrets):**
   - orchestrates workflow
   - performs section encryption via `contract-go` engine
   - validates signatures
   - stores encrypted payloads, hashes, and audit events
3. **HashiCorp Vault (trusted for build key material):**
   - manages signing/attestation RSA-4096 keys and key access policy
   - backend retrieves private key material only just-in-time for HPCR functions that require PEM keys (`HpcrContractSign`, `HpcrGetAttestationRecords`)
   - private key material is short-lived in backend memory and is never persisted to DB/files/logs or returned to clients
   - backend authenticates via AppRole (production) or dev root token
4. **Network:**
   - traffic intended through nginx reverse proxy
   - TLS termination at proxy in production mode
   - Vault on internal `app_net` network (not internet-exposed)
5. **Database:**
   - stores user/auth/audit/build metadata and encrypted artifacts
   - stores build key public keys and Vault references (not private keys)

### 3.2 Out-of-Scope Risks

- endpoint hardening of external identity providers (not used)
- host OS compromise on client or server
- Vault unsealing and disaster recovery (operator responsibility)

---

## 4. Identity and Authentication Controls

### 4.1 Bearer Token Model

- Login endpoint issues opaque random tokens.
- Backend stores token **hashes** only (`SHA-256`), never plaintext token values.
- Token validity is enforced by `created_at + TOKEN_EXPIRY`.
- Revoked tokens are rejected.

### 4.2 Setup Guard (First Login / Rotation Enforcement)

Authenticated users with incomplete setup are restricted to setup-safe endpoints only:

- `POST /auth/logout`
- `PATCH /users/{id}/password` (own account)
- `PUT /users/{id}/public-key` (own account)

All other routes return `403 ACCOUNT_SETUP_REQUIRED`.

Setup-required triggers include:

- `must_change_password = true`
- missing public key
- expired public key

---

## 5. Authorization Controls

### 5.1 Role-Based Access Control

System roles:

- `ADMIN`
- `SOLUTION_PROVIDER`
- `DATA_OWNER`
- `AUDITOR`
- `ENV_OPERATOR`
- `VIEWER`

### 5.2 Assignment-Based Access Control

Build actions require both:

1. global role entitlement
2. explicit assignment on that specific build/role

### 5.3 Build Visibility Guard

`RequireBuildAccess` middleware enforces `/builds/{id}/...` access:

- admin can access any build
- non-admin must be assigned on that build

`GET /builds` behavior:

- admin: full paginated list
- non-admin: assignment-filtered list

### 5.4 Assignment Integrity Rules

Build-level assignments are restricted to workflow personas:

- `SOLUTION_PROVIDER`
- `DATA_OWNER`
- `AUDITOR`
- `ENV_OPERATOR`

Additional guard:

- assignee must already hold the target role globally

---

## 6. Request Integrity and Anti-Replay

### 6.1 Signed Mutating Requests

All authenticated mutating methods (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) require:

- `X-Signature`
- `X-Signature-Hash`
- `X-Timestamp`
- optional `X-Key-Fingerprint`

Validation steps:

- timestamp freshness check (`+/-5 minutes`)
- authenticated user key availability check
- optional fingerprint match check
- canonical hash recomputation from method/path/body/timestamp
- RSA signature verification against registered user public key

### 6.2 Signature Exemptions

- `POST /auth/logout`
- `PATCH /users/{id}/password`
- `PUT /users/{id}/public-key`

These exemptions enable account setup and logout flows before full key state is available.

---

## 7. Workflow and State-Machine Security

### 7.1 Controlled Lifecycle

V2 state progression:

`CREATED -> SIGNING_KEY_REGISTERED -> WORKLOAD_SUBMITTED -> ENVIRONMENT_STAGED -> ATTESTATION_KEY_REGISTERED -> FINALIZED -> CONTRACT_DOWNLOADED`

Post-finalization attestation lifecycle (tracked by `attestation_state`):

`PENDING_UPLOAD -> UPLOADED -> VERIFIED|REJECTED`

Cancellation:

- allowed from non-terminal pre-finalized states

### 7.2 Download Acknowledgment Control

`CONTRACT_DOWNLOADED` is set only via `POST /builds/{id}/acknowledge-download`.

Security checks include:

- build is `FINALIZED`
- caller is assigned env operator
- submitted `contract_hash` equals stored build hash
- signature verifies with caller registered public key

After acknowledgment:

- status becomes `CONTRACT_DOWNLOADED`
- re-download/export/userdata/acknowledge paths are blocked

### 7.3 Post-Finalization Attestation Controls

- Evidence upload and verification are controlled by `attestation_state` and do not mutate the build status machine.
- Desktop unlocks evidence upload only after `CONTRACT_DOWNLOADED`.
- Backend upload endpoint accepts both signed JSON and `multipart/form-data` payloads under the same authz/signature controls.
- Rejected verification responses surface contract-go error details for auditor diagnosis while still recording terminal `REJECTED` state.

---

## 8. Cryptographic Security Model

### 8.1 Algorithms

- RSA-4096 identity keys
- RSA-PSS signatures (`SHA-256`)
- AES-256-GCM for environment payload encryption
- RSA-OAEP wrapping for symmetric keys
- SHA-256 hashing for request/content/audit linkage

### 8.2 Key Ownership

- **Identity private keys** remain client-side (Electron). Never transmitted.
- **Build signing/attestation private keys** are governed by HashiCorp Vault and may be retrieved only by backend workers at runtime for HPCR-required operations. They are never persisted outside Vault-managed custody.
- Backend stores identity public keys + fingerprints + expiry metadata.
- Backend stores build key public keys + Vault Transit key references.
- Backend verification always uses registered keys, never caller-supplied verification keys.

### 8.3 Build Key Security (Vault-Managed)

- Signing keys: RSA-4096. Final contract signatures are produced through `HpcrContractSign(...)` using key material retrieved just-in-time from Vault.
- Attestation keys: RSA-4096, generated in Vault or uploaded (public key only). Decryption paths that call `HpcrGetAttestationRecords(...)` require backend access to the corresponding private key material and may require a per-request passphrase when key material is encrypted.
- Key naming convention: `build-signing-<build_id>`, `build-attestation-<build_id>`.
- Backend authenticates to Vault via AppRole (production) or dev root token (development).
- Vault policy follows least privilege for build-scoped key refs only. Client-facing APIs never expose private keys, and backend key material handling is memory-only with post-operation zeroization. Attestation key passphrases are request-scoped, never persisted, and must be excluded from logs.

### 8.4 Data Classification (Stored)

Backend stores:

- encrypted section payloads
- wrapped symmetric keys (legacy v1 rows only; nullable/absent in v2-first submissions)
- section hashes/signatures
- contract hash and finalized contract YAML (which contains encrypted contract data)
- audit events and hash chain metadata

---

## 9. Audit, Integrity, and Non-Repudiation

### 9.1 Audit Chain

- genesis: `SHA256("IBM_CC:" + build_id)`
- each event hash links to previous event hash
- tampering or reordering breaks verification

### 9.2 Signature Expectations in Audit Verification

Signed event types expected by verification logic:

- `BUILD_CREATED`
- `SIGNING_KEY_CREATED`
- `WORKLOAD_SUBMITTED`
- `ENVIRONMENT_STAGED`
- `ATTESTATION_KEY_REGISTERED`
- `BUILD_FINALIZED`
- `CONTRACT_DOWNLOADED`
- `ATTESTATION_EVIDENCE_UPLOADED`
- `ATTESTATION_VERIFIED`

### 9.3 Verification Endpoints

- `GET /builds/{id}/verify` for chain/signature integrity
- `GET /builds/{id}/verify-contract` for finalized contract integrity and signature checks

## 10. Backend Runtime Hardening

### 10.1 Middleware Security Pipeline

Global middleware order:

1. panic recoverer
2. request ID
3. security headers
4. structured request logging
5. CORS enforcement
6. max body size
7. request timeout
8. rate limiting

Authenticated group middleware:

1. auth
2. setup guard
3. request-signature enforcement

### 10.2 Security Headers

Backend sets:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` on TLS requests

### 10.3 Rate Limiting

- global: `10 req/sec`, burst `20`
- login: `5 req/min`, burst `3`

### 10.4 CORS

- explicit allow-list by default
- `CORS_ALLOW_ALL` supported (intended for non-production/dev scenarios only)

---

## 11. Desktop Application Security Controls

### 11.1 Electron Runtime Hardening

`BrowserWindow` security flags:

- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false`
- `sandbox: true`
- `webviewTag: false`
- `webSecurity: true`
- `allowRunningInsecureContent: false`

### 11.2 Navigation and External Link Controls

- strict allow-list for in-app navigation URLs
- all child windows denied (`setWindowOpenHandler`)
- blocked `webview` attachment
- external URLs only through safe protocol allow-list (`https`, `http`, `mailto`)

### 11.3 IPC Boundary Protection

- all IPC handlers registered via centralized wrapper
- sender URL trust check on every IPC call
- untrusted sender requests rejected

### 11.4 Session/Permission Controls

- deny-all permission request/check/device handlers
- session storage cleanup on window close and app shutdown
- TLS certificate errors are rejected (`callback(false)`)

### 11.5 Renderer CSP

`app/index.html` defines CSP with:

- `default-src 'self'`
- `object-src 'none'`
- restrictive script/style/font/image/connect directives

---

## 12. Deployment Security Baseline

### 12.1 Reverse Proxy and Network Segmentation

Compose baseline provides:

- `reverse_proxy` exposed to host
- `backend` and `postgres` on internal networks
- `db_net` marked `internal: true`

### 12.2 Container Runtime Hardening

Implemented in compose:

- read-only root filesystems where applicable
- `tmpfs` for writable transient paths
- `no-new-privileges`
- dropped Linux capabilities (minimal add-back for nginx bind)
- resource limits on backend (`mem_limit`, `cpus`, `pids_limit`)

### 12.3 TLS in Production Overlay

`docker-compose.prod.yaml` + `config/nginx/tls.conf` provide:

- HTTPS listener on port `443` (mapped default `8443`)
- HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect
- certificate/key mounted as read-only
- HSTS and secure proxy forwarding headers

---

## 13. Logging and Security Observability

### 13.1 Request and Security Event Logging

Backend produces:

- structured HTTP request logs (method/path/status/duration/request-id/ip)
- middleware-generated security/system events (auth failures, setup blocks, rate limits, signature validation failures, RBAC denials)

### 13.2 System Log API Surface

- `GET /system-logs` available to `ADMIN` and `AUDITOR`
- supports paging (`limit`, `offset`)

---

## 14. Operational Security Checklist (Production)

Before go-live:

- enforce TLS by using production overlay and valid cert/key files
- set strong `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- set restrictive `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; keep `CORS_ALLOW_ALL=false`
- ensure `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true` only behind trusted proxy
- verify DB connectivity and migration success before exposing proxy
- **configure `KEY_PROVIDER=vault`** with production Vault cluster
- **verify Vault AppRole** credentials and Transit key policies
- **ensure Vault is on internal network** (not internet-exposed)
- validate first-login setup flow for all seeded/provisioned users
- verify signature enforcement on mutating endpoints
- verify audit + contract integrity checks on a full test build
- sign desktop binaries for distribution trust

---

## 15. Known Gaps and Future Hardening

Current known areas to improve:

- private key at-rest protection currently uses app-local machine-derived strategy; OS keychain integration would strengthen client key protection
- static embedded OpenAPI may lag implementation details
- no mTLS between reverse proxy and backend by default
- no mTLS between backend and Vault (recommended for production)
- Vault unsealing and HA configuration is operator responsibility
- additional automated security tests (negative-path and replay-focused) should be expanded
